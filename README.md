# Stock-Price-Prediction
This repository showcases a machine learning project designed to predict the performance of the SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX) by combining numerical and textual data analysis. The project features a hybrid approach that integrates historical stock price analysis with sentiment analysis of news headlines to create a well-rounded predictive model. The numerical analysis uses time-series forecasting and regression techniques to identify trends and patterns in past stock prices, while natural language processing (NLP) techniques are employed to evaluate sentiment from news articles, adding a qualitative layer to the prediction.

Key components of the project include data pre-processing, feature extraction, and the application of advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy. By synthesizing quantitative and qualitative data, the model offers deeper insights and better performance compared to traditional single-source prediction models. This project not only demonstrates the use of diverse data streams but also emphasizes the importance of data fusion in complex forecasting tasks, making it highly relevant for data scientists, AI practitioners, and financial analysts interested in leveraging AI for financial predictions.

The repository contains well-documented code, step-by-step explanations, and comprehensive data handling techniques to guide users through replicating or extending the work. It is an excellent resource for those aiming to understand how to merge time-series analysis with sentiment-based insights for robust stock market predictions.
